<h3>Anonymizing Files</h3>

Before anonymizing, first make sure that the application is in
anonymize mode using the <code>Anonymize &nbsp; Upload</code> radio
buttons at the top of the main window.

<p/>
<br/>

If a particular patient ID is desired, enter it in the <code>New Patient ID</code> 
field.  This field is initialized to a random value at startup.  The pattern for
this is defined in the configuration file.

<p/>
<br/>

Be default, the patient name is set to the same value as the patient ID.  If they
need to be different, click the checkbox to the right of the <code>New Patient Name</code> 
field, which will enable the field and a different name to be entered.

<p/>
<br/>
To anonymize a series,
click the <code>Anonymize</code> button to the
right of the series.  When complete, the white on green plus sign will
indicate that the series has been anonymized.

<p/>
<br/>

One of the features of the program is to properly handle the anonymization of UIDs
across files within a series and study.
<moreinfo 
title='This is true for many uses, but in
particular for Radiotherapy where the
relationships and cross-references between
DICOM files is complex.'>(more info)</moreinfo>
After anonymization, the generated files will have new UIDs and the relationships
between files will be maintained, provided that the files were anonymized in the
same session (program invocation).

<p/>
When files are anonymized, they are put in the <code>Destination</code> shown near the
top of the main screen.  The destination may be changed by:
<ul>
    <li>Using the <code>Browse</code> button</li>
    <li>Copy and pasting a folder name into the field</li>
    <li>Typing into the field</li>
</ul>
If the <code>Destination</code> does not exist, it will be created before anonymization begins.
If you do not have permission to write files, then anonymization will fail.
Note that repeatedly anonymizations will create a new set of files on each invocation.

<p/>
To anonymize an entire patient may be anonymized by clicking the <code>Anonymize Patient</code>
button in the uppor right hand corner of each patient's information.

<p/>

Multiple patients may be anonymized by clicking the <code>Anonymize All</code>
button at the bottom of the main window.
