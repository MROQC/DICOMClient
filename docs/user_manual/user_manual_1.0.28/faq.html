<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p/><br/>
<strong>Will DICOM+ over-write my existing files?</strong><br/>
No - The program is designed to preserve existing files.  Both anonymization and
editing create new copies of the files.  Before a new file is written, the program
checks to make sure that the name it is using is unique.
<br/>
Note that if the same series is anonymized multiple times, it will result in multiple
sets of files.  This is by design, as a common use case is to anonymize the same set
of files multiple times with different user IDs to create test data.

<p/>

The only exceptions are:

<ul>

<li>When editing a file, the user specifically indicates that the original file should be over-written.</li>

<li>When the user repeatedly saves during an edit session, the same destination file is used.</li>

</ul>



<p/><br/>
<strong>How does DICOM+ construct file names?</strong><br/>
File names are constructed so as to be human readable, and are formatted
with the following fields (if they are present in the source DICOM file) separated by underscore:

<ul>
<li>Patient ID</li>
<li>Modality</li>
<li>Series Number</li>
<li>Instance Number</li>
</ul>

If the resulting file already exists, an integer is appended to the name to make it unique.
