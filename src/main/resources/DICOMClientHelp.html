<center><h3>View, Anonymize, and Upload DICOM files</h3></center>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

The primary purpose of the DICOM Anonymize<up>/Upload</up> tool is
to anonymize DICOM files locally or cop from local storage
on the desktop and put them into the PACS servers.  The tool
also has a simple previewer, which can be used to view DICOM
files even if the user has no intention of anonymizing<up> or
uploading</up> them.

DICOM files can reside on any storage that the local system
recognizes, including hard disk, CD, DVD, USB, or thumb drives.


<h3>Starting the Program</h3>
The program may be started by either:

<ul>
  <li>dragging one or more DICOM files or directories onto the program icon</li>
  <li>double clicking the icon</li>
</ul>

<up>The program has two modes (Anonymize and Upload) indicated by radio
buttons near the top of the screen.  Choose the one that is appropriate
for your needs.  If you only wish to view (preview) files, then either
mode will suffice.
</up>

A file can be loaded by dragging it into the program.  To load an
entire directory, you can drag and drop a directory.  If a directory
is loaded, only the files immediately under that directory are loaded,
sub-directories are ignored.  It is also possible to select multiple
files and/or directories and drag them as a group, and they will all
be loaded.

Loading files does not change them in any way, and is a good way
to view DICOM files.

Double clicking the shortcut icon will also start the program, but
with no files loaded.

After the program has been started, the user may drag additional
files or directories into it and they will be added to the list.

Files are listed in a hierarchy, which has three levels:
<ul>
  <li>Patient</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Study</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Series</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
with descriptive information for each.  Individual files for each
series are not listed, but the number of files in each is shown.

For each series, there is a <b>Preview</b> and an <b>Anonymize</b>
<up> or an <b>Upload</b></up> button.  The <b>Preview</b> is used
to preview the series before anonymizing<up> or uploading</up>.

Any files that are not valid DICOM files, or, the
program lacks the necessary permissions to read them, will be
noted in the message field (lower left corner) and then ignored.


<h3>Anonymizing Files</h3>

Anonymizing creates copies of existing DICOM files with
selected fields anonymized.  New files are created, as
opposed to over-writing files, and the new files are named
with the new patient ID, modality, series number, and
instance (slice) number.  If necessary, an additional number
is added.  An example file name is:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ANON3968_CT_2_0021.DCM

To anonymize a series, <up>select the <b>Anonymize Mode</b>
radio button near the top center of the screen, and then</up>
click the <b>Anonymize</b> button next to the desired
series.  The user may perform anonymization on all series
under a given patient by clicking the <b>Anonymize
Patient</b> button, or may anonymize all series under all 
patients by clicking the <b>Anonymize All</b> button near the 
bottom right-hand corner of the window.

After an anonymization is complete, a green indicator will
be shown as confirmation.

<up>When Anonymize mode is selected with the radio button,
the destination and <b>Anonymize Options</b> button will
appear underneath, and all the <b>Upload</b> buttons will
change to <b>Anonymize</b>.  Each patient will show
fields indicating the new patient id and name.
</up>
By default, the destination is set to be a sub-directory
named <b>anonymize</b> underneath the first directory of
files loaded.  This may be changed by entering a new 
value or use the <b>Browse...</b> button to select a
directory.  If the directory chosen does not exist,
it will be created.

Clicking the <b>Anonymize Options</b> will display the 
<b>Anonymize Options</b> window, which allows the user to
customize the anonymization.

For each patient, a default patient ID is randomly chosen.
This may be changed if desired.  By default, the patient
name will be kept the same as the patient ID.  If the user
wants the patient name to be different from the patient ID, 
then click the checkbox to the right of the <b>New Patient
Name</b> field and set the name as desired.  When patient IDs
are automatically chosen, the application makes each of
them unique. 

By default, the list of fields is set up to reflect those
recommended by the DICOM standard.  The standard indicates
that this list may in some cases be insufficient.  For 
greater control over anonymization, use the <b>Anonymize
Options...</b> button to display the the <b>Anonymize
Options</b> window.  This window shows the fields that
will be anonymized and the new values to be used, except
for UID values which due to their complexity are handled
automatically.  In general, users will not need to modify
this list of values, but if so, then:

<ul>
  <li>New fields may be added with the <b>Add</b> button
        at the bottom of the window.
  <li>Fields may be de-activated by un-checking their
        corresponding checkboxes.
  <li>Alternate values for fields may be chosen with
        the text boxes.
</ul>

Note that existing files are never over-written, so
performing anonymization twice will create two sets of
files, even using the same source files.

New UIDs (such as SOPInstanceUID, SeriesInstanceUID, and 
StudyInstanceUID) are automatically generated and all old 
UIDs are discarded.  It is not possible to override this
feature.

When anonymizing multiple series that reference each other
via their UIDs, it is important to anonymize them all in the 
same session (invocation of the tool) so that the UIDs in
the anonymized files will be consistent across the different
series.

Anonymized files may be re-loaded into the program to
inspect the changes with the previewer.

<up><h3>To Upload DICOM Files</h3>

Select the desired destination PACS  by using the spinner (up
and down arrows) near the top of the screen until the the desired
PACS is shown.

To upload all of the series for all patients, use the <b>Upload All</b>
button.

While a series is being uploaded, its buttons are replaced
with a progress bar.  The display reverts back to the buttons
when the upload is complete.

When an upload of a complete series is successful, a green circle
with a white plus sign is shown next to its upload button.  If all
series have been uploaded, then an additional green icon is shown
next to the <b>Upload All</b> button.  These indicators are specific to
the PACS that files have been uploaded to.  In other words, if a
series is indicated to have been uploaded, it is only for the PACS
shown.  Switching to a different PACS will change the indicator
to reflect the upload status for that PACS.  The upload state is
reset when the program is exited, so if the program is restarted
with the same DICOM files, they will be shown as not having been
uploaded.
</up>
<h3>Previewing Files</h3>

To preview DICOM files, drag the slider for the corresponding
series and the preview window will be shown.  The preview window
can show files as either images or text.  There is a pair of
radio buttons at the bottom to select the mode.

The title of the preview window shows basic information that
identifies the series, and near the top of the window it
displays the file from which the data originated.

In image mode, the three sliders can be used to control the
contrast, brightness and size of the image.  Between the sliders
is a <b>Reset</b> button that resets the sliders to their
initial position, which shows the image in an un-altered
state.

In text mode, there is search field where the user can type
a string of text to search for.  Searches are case-insensitive,
and the currently selected matching string and the total
number of matching strings are indicated as <b>current of
total</b>.

Searches are literal (as opposed to wild card or
regular expressions), do not span lines, and can be used to
search the names of fields as well their as values.  The
down and up arrows next to the search field can be used to
navigate to the previous and next matches.

The user can also select text and use conventional copy and
paste to copy it to another application.

The text can not be modified in place.

In text mode there are also two shortcuts.  After clicking
in the text area:

<ul>
<li>Enter will position to the next matching text string.</li>
<li>Selecting text and then typing Ctrl-F will search for that text.</li>
</ul>

Pressing <b>Enter</b> from the search field will scroll the
text window to show the next match.  After the last match is
scrolled to, the window will scroll back to the first match.

<h3>Running from the Command Line</h3>

This progam can be invoked to anonymize from the command line,
which is useful for anonymizing large numbers of file or running
from a service that does not display a GUI.  The general command
line usage is:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>DICOMClient [ -c ] [ -P patient_id ] [ -o output_file ] [ -3 ] [ -z ] inFile1 inFile2 ...</b>
    
<ul>
    
<li>-c Run without GUI in command line mode</li>
<li>-P Specify new patient ID for anonymization</li>
<li>-o Specify output file for anonymization</li>
<li>-3 Restrict generated XML to 32 character tag names, as required by SAS</li>
<li>-z Replace each control character in DICOM attributes with a blank.  Required by SAS</li>
<li>-g Perform aggressive anonymization, which looks for instances of
the patient name and ID in all (not just anonymized) fields and anonymizes them.</li>
</ul>

Note that only anonymization is supported in non-GUI mode, not
uploading.

<h3>Additional Notes</h3>

<up>In general, uploading the same series multiple times has no real
effect, but the behaviour is dicatated by the destination PACS.
For ConQuest servers, the copy on the PACS is over written with
the newly uploaded copy. 

Once a file has been uploaded it can not be un-uploaded.
</up>
This program does not modify the original files on local storage.

It is possible that images contain imprinted text data that should
be anonymized, but this program does not support the blacking out
of this data.
