<h3>Previewing Files</h3>
<p>
To preview a DICOM series, click the <code>Preview</code> button to
the right of the series.  Previewing a file will not change it.
</p><p>
All DICOM files may be viewed in text mode, and those with images
may be viewed in image mode.  Below is an annotated screen shot of
the image preview: <br></br>

<p/>
In text mode, the meta-data of the files is shown.  Multi-valued
attributes have their list of values display with a separating '\'
between each value.  DICOM sequences are shown with indenting to
reflect the hierarchy.
</p><p>
Optionally, the <code>Details</code> checkbox may be checked, which
prefixes each attribute with the <br/>
<ul>
<li>group number</li>
<li>element number</li>
<li><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM#Value_representations'>value representation</a></li>
<li><a href='ValueMultiplicity.html'>value multiplicity</a></li>
</ul>

</p><p>
The group and element numbers uniquely define the attribute.
The value representation indicates the type of value (string,
floating point, etc), and the value multiplicity indicates how
many values may be specified.  For example, a value multiplicity of <code>1</code>
indicates that the attribute must have exactly one value, and a value multiplicity of <code>1-N</code>
indicates that the attribute must have one or more values.
See <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM#Value_representations'>Value Representations</a>
and <a href='ValueMultiplicity.html'>Value Multiplicity</a> for details.
